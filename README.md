# dogSlideShowProject
This project was one of the early projects done in my iOS mobile apps development class.  It uses one view controller to display a dogs photo, name of the dog, a gif of the dog, and the option to go to the next or previous dog if need be.  The user can interact with the next or previous buttons and look at each dog (there are 3 different dogs in total as my professor wanted the project to be small).
